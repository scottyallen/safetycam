      <h1>Want to stand up to hatred?</h1>
      <h1>Pin this on your shirt.</h1>

      <p>
        <b>WHAT</b>:
        The SafetyCam is a small camera you can pin on your shirt.
        See hatred or intolerance?
        Push the button and immediately start filming.
        No need to fumble with your phone.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>WHY</b>:
        Most hate crimes are not recorded and never reported.
        Filming hate can expose abuse, substantiate reports, deter violence and serve as evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wearing the SafetyCam proclaims to the world - <i>I am intolerant of intolerance.</i>
        I will stick up for you.
        I promise to not stand aside.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>COST</b>:
        Below $30.
      </p>

      <p>More details:</p>
      
      <p>
        I am an entrepreneur and software/hardware engineer.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was horrified by the public response to Brexit and the US election.
        I was deeply saddened to hear multiple stories from close friends of racist and homophic slurs and violence in my home of San Francisco just after the election.
        People intervened in the moment, but no one got it on video.
        Many other haven't seen anything themselves, and therefore don't believe it's happening.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Brexit, people started <a class='website' href="http://boingboing.net/2016/11/11/signal-your-opposition-to-raci.html">pinning safety pins</a> on their shirts as a way of indicating that they're willing to act as an ally and help someone facing harrassment or violence in public.
        This has started taking off in the US, but has been critized as not going far enough, and just being a way for people to assuage their guilt.
        A particularly well written <a class='website' href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dear-white-people-your-safety-pins-are-embarassing_us_58278b9de4b02b1f5257a36a">article in the Huffington Post</a> calls upon white people to take responsibility for Trump's election.
        Trump's election was not the start of racism or hatred in the US.
        Rather than trying to make ourselves feel better by labeling ourselves as not racist and feeling good about ourselves, now is a time to reflect on how we can change our actions to effect real, long lasting change.

        During the election, I was in living in Shenzhen, China, where I've been on and off over the past year.  
        Shenzhen is the center of electronics manufacturing in the world.
        I want to take my knowledge of electronics manufacturing to make something people can actually use to make a difference.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I went to the Huaqiangbei wholesale electronics markets, and looked for a simple, cheap, and easy-to -use camera that I could send to friends in the US.
        But I couldn't find one.
        There were small, cheap wearable cameras, but they weren't simple or easy to use.
        And there were big, bulky, expensive body cameras for policemen that weren't easy to use either.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I set out to make the SafetyCam.
        I've been working with existing manufacturers of small, cheap wearable cameras to modify their design to be easy to use and attractive to wear, while still being very affordable.
        Because we are modifying an existing design, I hope to have something ready by early 2017.

      <p>FAQ:</p>

      <p>Q: Wouldn't it be better for people to just step in and stop hatred when they see it?</p>
      <p>
        A: Yes - ideally everyone steps in whenever they see someone being hateful, intolerant, or violent.
        But not everyone feels comfortable doing that in all circumstances.
        If we don't feel safe ourselves, it can be hard to be brave and to step in.
        Documenting and exposing hatred and violence may not stop a situation in the moment, but may help shift public mindset.
        Everyone contributes in their own way, to the level they are able.
      </p>

      <p>Q: Won't wearing a camera make me a target?</p>
      <p>
        A: It might.
        Wearing a camera isn't for everyone - if you're already concerned about your personal safety in public, you might not want to wear something that will call attention to yourself.
        But if you're like me and lucky enough to not be harrrased or intimidated in public regularly, consider standing up for others who may not be so lucky.
        Wearing a camera and filming of incidents of intolerance, hatred, or violence when you see them is one way to do that.
      </p>

      <p>Q: What about privacy - shouldn't we have fewer cameras, rather than more?</p>
      <p>
        A: The reality is that there are already cameras everywhere in public, filming everyone.
        Some of these cameras are owned and operated by various government, law enforcement, or public agencies and feed directly into government surveillance systems.
        Others are owned by private companies and individuals, and the video footage my unknowingly be aggregated into government surveillance systems.
        There is a very real decrease in the amount of privacy for all of us when all our comings and goings are recorded and correlated.
        However, this footage is rarely easy accessed by private individuals when an incident of intolerance, hatred, or violence occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SafetyCam makes it easier to get quick access to footage of incidents, without feeding government surveillance systems.
        You get to choose what video footage you film, and what you want to do with it.
        You can choose to share it privately, upload it to social media, or share it with the news media or law enforcement.
        But the choice is yours - it will never be automatically provided to government surveillance systems.
      </p>

      <p>Q: Aren't there cameras already like this available for purchase?</p>
      <p>
        A: Yes, but they either suck or are really expensive.
        I looked really hard for something off the shelf that was small, easy to use, and cheap.
        I couldn't find anything that met all of those criteria.
        So I'm working with a Chinese manufacturer that already makes small, cheap wearable cameras to build a camera that's easy to use and looks great.
        The technology already exists, it just need to be refined into something that's friendly.
      </p>

      <p>Q: Isn't filming people illegal?</p>
      <p>
        A: In the United states, in general, no, not if you're doing it in public, there isn't a reasonable expectation of privacy, and not you're trying to hide it.
        The SafetyCam has a red light whenever you're filming to let others know.
        If you live outside the US, you should check your local laws.
      </p>

      <p>Q: Doesn't filming people collect more data for the authorities to use against us?</p>
      <p>
        A: The SafetyCam only records when you push the button.
        If you are in sensitive situations such as protests where authorities may use video footage to unfairly punish or target people, simply don't film.
      </p>

      <p>Q: How do I get the video off the camera?</p>
      <p>
        A: There is a micro USB port (the same as many phones) that you can use to plug it into your computer.
        No software required - you can copy the video files directly off as if it was a USB drive.
