      <h1>Really want to fight racism and hatred?</h1>
      <h1>Pin this on your shirt instead.</h1>

      <p><b>WHAT</b>: The SafetyCam is a small camera you can pin on your shirt.  See hatred or intolerance?  Push the button and
immediately start recording.  No need to fumble with your phone.</p>
      <p><b>WHY</b>: Hate crimes and public harrassment are on the rise.  Hateful people are emboldened by racist leaders rising to power.  It's time to fight hatred by shining a light on it.</p>
<p>The SafetyCam is a badge you wear to proclaim to the world - I am intolerant of intolerance and will do something about it. I will expose publicly expose you when you are hateful.  I will submit evidence of your violence.  I promise to not stand aside.</p>

        I am an entrepreneur and software/hardware engineer.

        I was horrified by the public response to Brexit and the US election.
        I've heard multiple reports of hate crimes and harrassment in my normally tolerant and accepting home of San Francsico.
        People intervened in the moment, but no one got it on video.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Brexit, people started <a class='website' href="http://boingboing.net/2016/11/11/signal-your-opposition-to-raci.html">pinning safety pins</a> on their shirts as a way of indicating that they're willing to act as an ally and help someone facing harrassment or violence in public.

        This has started taking off in the US, but has been <a class='website' href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dear-white-people-your-safety-pins-are-embarassing_us_58278b9de4b02b1f5257a36a">critized</a> by minorities as not going far enough, and just being a way for people to assuage their guilt.

        I've been living on and off in Shenzhen, China, the center of electronics manufacturing in the world.

        I want to take my knowledge of electronics manufacturing to make something people can actually use to make a difference.

      <p>FAQ:</p>

      <p>Q: Aren't there cameras already like this available for purchase?
      <p>A: Yes, but they either suck or are really expensive.  I looked really hard for something off the shelf that was small, easy to use, and cheap.  I couldn't find anything that met all of those criteria.  So I'm working with a Chinese manufacturer that already makes small, cheap wearable cameras to build a camera that's easy to use and looks great.  The technology already exists, it just need to be refined into something that's friendly.</p>

      <p>Q: Wouldn't it be better for people to just step in and stop hatred when they see it?</p>
      <p>A: Yes - ideally everyone steps in whenever they see someone being hateful, intolerant, or violent.  But not everyone feels comfortable doing that in all circumstances.  If we don't feel safe ourselves, it can be hard to be brave and to step in.  Documenting and exposing hatred and violence may not stop a situation in the moment, but may help shift public mindset.  Everyone contributes in their own way, to the level they are able.</p>

      <p>Q: Isn't recording people illegal?</p>
      <p>A: In general, no, not if you're doing it in public, there isn't a reasonable expectation of privacy, and not you're trying to hide it. The SafetyCam has a red light whenever you're recording to let others know. [TODO: check this]</a>

    <p>Q: Doesn't recording people collect more data for the authorities to use against us?</p>
    <p>A: The SafetyCam only records when you push the button.  If you are in sensitive situations such as protests where authorities may use video footage to unfairly punish or target people, simply don't record.</p>

    <p>Q: How do I get the video off the camera?</p>
    <p>A: There is a micro USB port (the same as many phones) that you can use to plug it into your computer.  No software required - you can copy the video files directly off as if it was a USB drive.</p>
